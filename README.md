# About TODO List project

TODO List is a full stack hobby project that I have built to practice/try some technologies and coding approaches.

Laravel, PHP and Mysql are on the backend side.
Vue3, JavaScript, TypeScript, TailwindCSS are on the frontend side.
Glue between front and back side is InertiaJS.
